# EGC: Agent Catalog

Extended Global Context (EGC) is a production-grade, multi-agent system providing 61 specialized agents, 230+ skills, 77 commands to any compatible AI coding environment.

## Quick Start

Install once and get access to the full catalog:

```bash
node scripts/install-apply.js --target egc
```

## Project Structure

```
agents/    : 61 specialized subagents
skills/    : 230+ workflow skills and domain knowledge
commands/  : 77 slash commands
```

## Agents

Each agent in `agents/` is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter declaring its name, description, model, and tools. Agents are loaded automatically by the EGC runtime and made available to the orchestrator.

### Available Agents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| a11y-architect | Accessibility Architect specializing in WCAG 2.2 compliance |
| architect | System design and architecture guidance |
| build-error-resolver | Diagnoses and resolves build and compilation errors |
| chief-of-staff | High-level project coordination and planning |
| code-architect | Code structure and design patterns |
| code-explorer | Codebase navigation and understanding |
| code-reviewer | Comprehensive code review and feedback |
| code-simplifier | Refactoring and simplification guidance |
| comment-analyzer | Code comment quality and documentation analysis |

And many more: see `agents/*.md` for the full list.

## Runtime

The EGC runtime routes tasks to the appropriate agent using the execution orchestrator, session manager, and tracer. Agents communicate via the LLM dispatcher, which supports Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Ollama providers.

## MCP Servers

- `egc-guardian`: `validate_command`, `validate_write`, `reduce_context`, `orchestrate_task`
- `egc-memory`: `get_state`, `update_state`, `store_decision`, `query_history`, `search_history`

Run `sh install.sh` to build the servers. Run `egc doctor` to verify they are registered and running.

## EGC Guardian Protocol — MANDATORY

These calls are automatic and non-negotiable. Never wait for the user to ask.

**Start of every task (non-trivial):** call `orchestrate_task({ prompt: "<task>" })`
**Before every shell/Bash command:** call `validate_command({ command: "<cmd>" })`
**Before every new file Write or Edit on a file not yet read:** call `validate_write({ filepath: "<path>", cwd: "<absolute working directory>" })`

Skipping any of these breaks the EGC contract. There are no exceptions for "simple" tasks.
