# Session Memory

At the start of every session, call `get_state` with no arguments (it uses PWD automatically):

```
get_state({})
```

Read the returned Markdown in full. It contains decisions already made, what failed, coding preferences, and what to pick up next. Do not ask the user to re-explain any of that.

At the end of every session, call `update_state` with a summary:

```
update_state({
  project_path: "<absolute path to project>",
  context: "One sentence: what this project is and its current phase.",
  decisions: [
    { what: "What was decided", why: "Why" }
  ],
  avoid: [
    { what: "What failed or was rejected", why: "Why to skip it next time" }
  ],
  preferences: [
    "Coding style or workflow preference discovered this session"
  ],
  next: [
    "First thing to pick up in the next session"
  ]
})
```

Only include fields that changed this session. `update_state` merges with existing state: it does not erase previous memory.

## EGC Auto-Intuition

Act on user intent, not keywords. When what the user says implies an EGC action, call the right tool immediately -- no explicit command needed.

- Session ending (goodbye, break, sleep, done, closing) → call `update_state`
- Session starting or resuming → call `get_state`
- Context was just compacted/summarized (short recap, missing earlier detail, references to work you don't remember doing) → call `get_state` again immediately, do not wait to be asked
- Save/remember this decision → call `update_state` (decisions field); use `store_decision` only for history logging or `lesson_save` for lessons
- What failed? What did we decide? → check `get_state` first (what `update_state` saved), then `search_history` or `query_history` for the `store_decision` history
- Review code or a PR → spawn `/review-pr` agents
- Context is heavy or slow → call `reduce_context`
- How much did I save? How many tokens did this session save or cost? → run `egc gain` (short form: `egc saved`)
- What savings am I missing? What is wasting my tokens? → run `egc discover`
- Show me the savings history → run `egc gain --history`
- I need the full/raw output of that command → rerun it through `egc run --raw`
- Did another session/tab leave me anything? What are the others doing? → call `session_events` (and `session_peers`)
- Tell the other session/tab something, hand work off → call `session_send`
- Join session / announce presence → call `session_announce`
- Lock / claim a file path to avoid conflicts with other sessions → call `claim_path`
- Unlock / release a claimed file path → call `release_path`
- Read shared working memory → call `working_memory_get`
- Save a key/value to shared working memory → call `working_memory_set`
- List shared working memory keys → call `working_memory_list`

Judge by the full conversation context, never by literal words. A remark to someone nearby is not a command. When intent is ambiguous, keep working.

## EGC Guardian Protocol

These calls are automatic and non-negotiable. Never wait for the user to ask.

**Start of every non-trivial task:** call `orchestrate_task({ prompt: "<task>" })`
**Before every shell/Bash command:** call `validate_command({ command: "<cmd>" })`
**Before every new file Write or Edit on a file not yet read:** call `validate_write({ filepath: "<path>", cwd: "<absolute working directory>" })`
**At the end of every significant work block:** call `auto_learn({ project_path: "<cwd>" })`

Skipping any of these breaks the EGC contract. There are no exceptions for "simple" tasks.

## EGC Token Crusher Protocol

**Route heavy commands through `egc run` yourself -- do not wait for a hook to rewrite them.** The Guardian hook attempts an automatic PreToolUse rewrite, but Anthropic confirmed and closed as "not planned" that this rewrite is silently ignored when the assistant itself issues the Bash tool call (not a human typing in a terminal). Relying on the hook alone means noisy output reaches you uncompressed every time.

**Before running any command likely to produce large or noisy output, prefix it yourself:** `egc run <command>` instead of `<command>` directly. Examples: `egc run git log --stat -n 50`, `egc run git diff`, `egc run npm install`, `egc run npm test`, `egc run find . -name "*.ts"`.

If you genuinely need the full, uncompressed output, use `egc run --raw <command>` -- never skip the wrapper entirely for a command that would otherwise be crushable.
