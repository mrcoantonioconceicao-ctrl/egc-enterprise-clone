 *
 * A move is added to the directories the line could already be in, never put
 * in their place: a cd that fails leaves the next command after `;` where it
 * was, and one inside a subshell does not outlive it, and the hook does not
 * follow either. A target only known when the command runs (a variable the
 * line does not fix, a substitution, a CDPATH search, a directory stack the
 * shell had before the line) leaves the directory unknown from there on,
 * with the reason, and the caller fails closed on a script named by a
 * relative path after it.
