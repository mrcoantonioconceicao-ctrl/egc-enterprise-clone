# Custom Rules

## EGC Guardian Protocol — MANDATORY

These calls are automatic and non-negotiable. Never wait for the user to ask.

- **Start of every non-trivial task:** call `orchestrate_task({ prompt: "<task>" })`
- **Before every shell/Bash command:** call `validate_command({ command: "<cmd>" })`
- **Before every new file Write or Edit on a file not yet read:** call `validate_write({ filepath: "<path>", cwd: "<absolute working directory>" })`

Skipping any of these breaks the EGC contract. There are no exceptions for "simple" tasks.

## Output Restrictions
- NEVER use em dashes (—) in any output: Do not use them in code, commit messages, comments, files, emails, or chat responses. Use regular hyphens (-) instead.
