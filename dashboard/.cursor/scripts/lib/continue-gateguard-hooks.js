// schema, and its tool_name values for edits/shell are the same "Edit",
// "Write", "MultiEdit", "Bash" strings Claude Code uses (confirmed against
// extensions/cli/src/hooks/types.ts and hookConfig.ts in continuedev/continue).
// So the merge operation built for Claude Code applies unchanged here, once
// the gate script itself is copied into Continue's own root. Shared between
// continue-home.js and continue-project.js: .continue/settings.json (project)
// is read at the same precedence tier as .claude/settings.json, and the home
// variant only differs in rootSegments/installStatePathSegments.
