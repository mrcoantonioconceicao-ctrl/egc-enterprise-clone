// CLI face of mcp-register.js for the shell installers.
//
// install.sh and install.ps1 used to carry their own hand-written copy of
// the registration list, and the three copies had already drifted: the
// shells never registered Continue.dev or Zed, install.ps1 pointed OpenCode
// at a different directory than everything else, and only the shells gated
// Gemini CLI on Antigravity being absent. Whoever installed through the
// shell silently got fewer tools wired up than whoever ran `egc init`.
// There is one list now, and all three paths read it from here.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/lib/mcp-register-cli.js <guardianBin> <memoryBin>
//
// A project .mcp.json is picked up from the working directory this runs in,
// which the shell installers set to the directory the person invoked them
// from. It is only ever merged when it already exists: creating a project
// config in a directory nobody asked about is litter, and the package's own
// bundled .mcp.json is nobody's project.
