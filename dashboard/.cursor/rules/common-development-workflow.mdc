# Development Workflow

> This rule extends the git workflow rule with the full feature development process that happens before git operations.

The Feature Implementation Workflow describes the development pipeline: planning, TDD, code review, and then committing to git.

## EGC Guardian Protocol — MANDATORY

These calls are automatic and non-negotiable. Never wait for the user to ask.

- **Start of every non-trivial task:** call `orchestrate_task({ prompt: "<task>" })`
- **Before every shell/Bash command:** call `validate_command({ command: "<cmd>" })`
- **Before every new file Write or Edit on a file not yet read:** call `validate_write({ filepath: "<path>", cwd: "<absolute working directory>" })`

Skipping any of these breaks the EGC contract. There are no exceptions for "simple" tasks.

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - See the git workflow rule for commit message format and PR process
